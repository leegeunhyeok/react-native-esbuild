# Hot Module Replacement

Esbuild doesn't currently support Hot Module Replacement(HMR).

Metro is implementing HMR capabilities based on [react-refresh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-refresh). I'll be looking at working with this, but as it is one of the complex implementations, unfortunately not sure when it will be available.
