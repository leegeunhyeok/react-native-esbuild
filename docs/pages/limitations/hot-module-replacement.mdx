# Hot Module Replacement

<Callout type="warning">
  HMR(Hot Module Replacement) is experimental.
</Callout>

esbuild doesn't currently support Hot Module Replacement(HMR).

So, I working hard for implement custom HMR and it's partially available as an experimental feature.

You can enable HMR by `experimental.hmr` set to `true` in your configuration file.

```js
/**
 * @type {import('@react-native-esbuild/core').Config}
 */
exports.default = {
  // ...
  experimental: {
    hmr: true,
  },
};
```

and here are some limitations.

- Detects changes in the `<projectRoot>/*` only.
- Changes detected in `<projectRoot>/node_modules/*` will be ignored and fully refreshed after rebuild.
